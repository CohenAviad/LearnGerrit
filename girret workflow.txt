git commit -m "commit note"
git push	//	pushes to gerrit, not to git - this sends notification to reviewer

// the reviewer reviews the commit, and comment on it
// we can see the comments in the mail and in the gerrit website
//	http://gerrit.zadara-qa.com:8080/dashboard/self

// fix the reviewe, then :
git commit --am	//	this pushed to the last commit

// if the reviewer approved the commit, he will comment (+2) in the gerrit
//	this will push the change in the github

//	if the commit // edit is total loss, and we don`t want it, we can abandon - from the website
//	abandon will remove it from the server, but not from the computer, thus we need to refetch
